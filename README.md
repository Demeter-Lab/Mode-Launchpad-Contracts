## Inspiration

## What it does

ModePad is a LaunchPad platform that facilitates the fundraising and initial distribution of new cryptocurrency projects building on Mode blockchain. 


## How we built it
We created ModePad, a LaunchPad on the Mode blockchain, simplifying fundraising for new crypto projects. The focus was on user-friendly design, smart contracts for automation, and a secure interface. 
Made use of technologies like solidity, nextjs, ethers.js, firebase and the mode blockchain



## Challenges we ran into
Smooth integration of the smart contract and backend system.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Integrating with ModePad's unique Sequential Fee Sharing mechanism

## What we learned
We learnt alot about mode blockchain, their sfs technology and all of that

## What's next for ModePad
We intend to integrate features like token locker and auto liquidity to the most popular mode dex. Launch on the dev mainnet and eventually launch on the mainnet.
